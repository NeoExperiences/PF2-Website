A little patch turned into a full blown update.

## Gameplay

- General
	- Added map logic for all of our Arena maps to end after a team has won 5 times. The absolute limit is 10 rounds. Updated arena_well to reflect this.
	- The flag is thrown instead of dropped upon the flag holder's death
	- Flags now reset back to their base if they are thrown into deathpits or into a func_respawnroom trigger
	- Increased the MIRV Grenade's base damage to 120 (from 100)
	- Increased the Frag Grenade's base damage to 100 (from 90)
	- Added lead in sounds to the MIRV Grenade, the EMP Grenade, and the Heal Grenade. This lets you know if one of these grenades will go off around you, as these grenades are devastating compared to the rest.
	- Added unique sounds for the grenades, including impact sounds, activation sounds, etc. 
	- Updated grenade sounds
	- Removed the infection icon particle that appeared above players and replaced it with a green coloring over the player model
	- Added sounds that play when a player is infected

- Soldier/Demoman
	- Added a 20% self explosive damage resistance to Soldier and Demoman (does not apply to grenade jumping) 
	- Added a new detonatable pipebomb model for Demoman
	- Buffed the Grenade Launcher's base damage to 90 damage (from 80 damage)
	
	
- Pyro
	- Nerfed the afterburn duration to 6 seconds (from 10 seconds)
	- Decreased the flame rocket radius to 150 H/U (from 198 H/U) 
	
	
- Heavy
	- Reduced the Minigun's rev up and rev down time by 25%
	- Tightened the Minigun's spread with a variation of 0.08 degrees, from a variation of 0.1 degrees
	- Slightly buffed Heavy's grenade jumping capabilities
	
	
- Engineer
	- Increased redeploying construction speed by 50% for Teleporters and Dispensers, to mirror Live TF2
	- All of Engineer's buildings' construction speed is 50% faster when being hit with a Wrench, to mirror Live TF2
	- Building gibs now give primary and secondary ammo
	- Extended the Sentry Gun's frag grenade explosion resistance to all hand grenade explosions, and slightly lowered the grenade resistance values:
		- Level 1: none
		- Level 2: 10% (from 15%) 
		- Level 3: 20% (from 33%)
	- Gave the EMP the ability to disarm remote detonatable pipebombs
	- Slightly nerfed the max possible detonation base damage for dispensers (220 damage -> 200 damage)
	- Added a HUD notification for buildings for when they're disabled by the EMP
	
	
- Medic
	- The Heal Grenade now explodes on teammate impact, similar to a grenade launcher pipe impact on enemies
	- Made the "Special Kind of Medicine" achivement harder to acquire due to the change above, requiring 5 teammates to heal at the same time instead of 3
	- Slightly nerfed the Medic's Syringe base damage from 65 to 50 to compensate for the infection mechanic
	- The Heal Grenade now grants 1% of Übercharge for every player it heals
	- The Übercharge HUD element now draws while the Syringe is out


- Sniper
	- Added a bullet tracer to the Sniper Rifle
	- Added a unique animation that plays when charging the Sniper Rifle without zooming in


- Spy
	- Reverted a change from the previous patch which made Spy disguised fake health and armor update as if they were hurt. This gave away Spies' disguises too easily.
	- Disguised Spies can now pick up health kits and armor kits to regenerate their disguised health and armor, like Live TF2
