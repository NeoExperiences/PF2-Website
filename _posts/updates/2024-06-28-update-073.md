## Balance Changes 
- ### General
	- Adjusted how explosive radius damage is calculated
	
- ### Scout
	- #### Class
		- Armor increased to 50 (from 25)
	- #### Caltrops
		- Reduced the deploy time to 0.6 seconds (from 0.8 seconds)
		
- ### Soldier
	- #### Class
		- Armor decreased to 125 (from 150)
		- Self rocket blast damage resistance increased to 40% ( from 20%)
		- Changed blast jumping to feel more like Live TF2
		
- ### Pyro
	- #### Flamethrower
		- Increased base primary damage to 180 (from 170)
		- Increased the flame rocket's projectile speed to 850 HU/s (from 750 HU/s)
		- Increased the flame rocket's base damage to 25 (from 20)
		- Decreased the flame rocket's radius to 100 HU (from 150 HU)
		
- ### Demoman
	- #### Class
		- Self pipebomb blast damage resistance increased to 25% (from 20%)
		
- ### Engineer
	- #### Class
		- Health increased to 90 (from 80)
		- Added Armor Regeneration. Works similar to Medic's health regeneration: You will now regenerate at a rate of 1-3 armor per second depending on how long it's been since you've been hit.
		
- ### Medic
	- #### Medigun
		- The medigun speed buff, which allowed you to run at Scout's speed while healing him, is disabled by default
		
- ### Sniper
	- #### Sniper Rifle
		- You can no longer shoot while jumping; you can still shoot in the air if it wasn't initiated with a jump
		
- ### Spy
	- #### Class
		- Added Spywalking, a feature which allows you to use Spy's normal speed if you're disguised as a slower class. Holding down the Spywalk button will allow you to travel at the Spy's normal speed as a slower class. There's also a toggle option if you don't wish to hold down the button in the advanced options. It is bound to Shift by default. You may have to bind the key after updating the game.
		- Disguising calculations are simpler; instead of faking a random health and armor value if a viable disguise target isn't available, the max health and armor for the disguised class will be faked instead.
		- Disguised Spies can now fake Medic Übercharge values

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an exploit where extremely large VTFs could crash servers (Thanks sappho!)
- Fixed an exploit relating to the Pipebomb Launcher's primary fire and Flamethrower's secondary fire

- Flamethrower secondary fire charging now has proper client prediction
- Fixed an oversight where players couldn't be Übercharged if they were holding the flag; the flag now drops when the flag carrier gets Übercharged

- The voice status UI element is now affected by cl_drawhud
- Fixed a visual bug where constantly rotating func_rotating brushes would suddenly freeze
- Fixed Civilian not properly being accounted for in the UI
- Fixed an issue with the keyvalue "texturename" in env_projectedtexture
- Fixed some flag trails not appearing at all
- Fixed a bug where invisible Spies can say Payload lines
- Fixed a bug where the target ID of a disguised Spy could show as overheal if disguising as a class with higher max health 
- Fixed a bug where attacking disguised Spies on the Payload would show their own team's healing particle (blue healing particle on red player)
- Fixed a visual bug with the Bottle where touching a resupply trigger would switch to the broken bodygroups
- Fixed a visual bug with classes not doing their attacking emotions when firing their weapon
- Fixed teleporter exits detonating while attempting to teleport players in places you would normally be able to teleport to
- Fixed a bug where voice commands were turned off by default in the chat window
- Fixed a bug where pipebombs in the air could be pushed by other explosives
- Fixed many issues with the talker, response rules, and scene files so classes are a lot more talkative
