The main menu is a combination of influence from a wide variety of Source engine games. It draws most directly from the TF2 Orange Box Menu and the TF2 Menu from Circa 2012. These are the two menus I spent the most time with growing up with TF2. I would play Orange Box in the morning before school and TF2 on the home computer when I got home. These being nostalgic for me it was important to incorporate them into the new Pre-Fortress 2 main menu, loading menu, and pause menu.

I joined the PF2 development team rather suddenly and to quote Cyanide in a "P2Join" fashion. I joined the team alongside Justyn, a developer of the beloved Team Fortress: Source 2. We weren't expecting to join the PF2 Team that day but when we were unable to find a download for other similar Source mods, we decided to try playing PF2 again. I have an affinity for web domains, and when I noticed the team was still using "prefortress.ml", I knew what I had to do. I quickly purchased the "prefortress.com" domain and offered it to the project lead. From there I found small projects to help with with in the development server. Where Justyn took a liking to updating various particle, I found a fondness for design projects and asset development.

Coming back to the menu, it was high time for change. The original menu can still be found with the launch option "-oldui", but the menu is in line with our progressive new ideology of PF2. The mod has been held back for years with the concept of being "beta accurate", it was time to let go of that nostalgia blocked mindset. We are working on bridging the gap between TFC and TF2 beta. We're dropping unfinished concepts like soldier's grenade eggs, and working on finishing concepts like the original control point models. The modern influences of the PF2 menu come from our Source mod family members and the new Steam Deck UI of HL2. One of my most ambitious endeavors to help the development of PF2 was asking Cyanide if I could design the new UI. He told me that "If you design a menu don't make it like [TF2Vintage] and don't make it like tf2c". I took that to heart and set out to make something unique with it's own voice. The colors draw from our "pizza" colored icons, which prompted our 0.7 update to be codenamed internally as "pizza". This menu has neat features not found in other menu systems (Thanks to the brilliance of Cyanide), including a team specific pause menu, a menu button that tells you how many servers are online, as well as various button name differences.

I am so proud of this design and I hope that you enjoy playing Pre-Fortress 2 v0.7.
