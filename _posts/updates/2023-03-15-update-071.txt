Pyro
	Nerfed the afterburn duration to 6 seconds (from 10 seconds)
	Decreased the flame rocket radius to 150 H/U (from 198 H/U) 
	
Heavy
	Reduced the Minigun's rev up and rev down time by 25%
	Tightened the Minigun's spread with a variation of 0.08 degrees, from a variation of 0.1 degrees
	Slightly buffed Heavy's grenade jumping capabilities
	
Engineer
	Increased redeploying construction speed by 50% for Teleporters and Dispensers, to mirror Live TF2
	All of Engineer's buildings' construction speed is 50% faster when being hit with a Wrench, to mirror Live TF2
	Building gibs now give primary and secondary ammo
	Extended the Sentry Gun's frag grenade explosion resistance to all hand grenade explosions, and slightly lowered the grenade resistance values 
		Level 1: none
		Level 2: 10% (from 15%) 
		Level 3: 20% (from 33%)
	Gave the EMP the ability to disarm remote detonatable pipebombs
	Slightly nerfed the max possible detonation base damage for dispensers (220 damage -> 200 damage)
	Added a building HUD notification for when they're disabled by the EMP
	
Medic
	The Heal Grenade now explodes on teammate impact, similar to a grenade launcher pipe impact on enemies
	Made the "Special Kind of Medicine" achivement harder to acquire due to the change above, requiring 5 teammates to heal instead of 3

Sniper
	Added a bullet tracer to the Sniper Rifle

Spy
	Reverted a change from the previous patch which made Spy disguised fake health and armor update as if they were hurt. This gave away Spies' disguises too easily.

General
	The flag is thrown instead of dropped upon the flag holder's death
	Flags now reset back to their base if they are thrown into deathpits or into a func_respawnroom trigger
