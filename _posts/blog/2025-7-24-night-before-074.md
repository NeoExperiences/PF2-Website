'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the code,
Not a bug was stirring, no errors to load.
Our devs were all nestled, snug in their chairs,
Hoping our patch wouldn’t break or have snares.

But just as we thought we were finally done,
A few more ideas bubbled up, and we had a little fun.
“We’ve got this! We’ve got that!” Each feature we found,
The list kept on growing, ideas unbound.

“We’re close,” we said, “just a few tweaks more,”
But the list of changes kept growing—oh, what a chore!
New maps, modes, features, new stuff galore,
You could say it started to feel like Christmas… and more.

As midnight drew near, we checked the date,
It wasn’t Christmas, just a bit too late.
We froze. We stared. Could it really be?
It’s July 24th?! What happened to our tree?

Yep. Turns out, it’s not Christmas. Not by a mile.
But here we are, feeling festive in style.
So what started as a patch, a simple repair,
Has snowballed into something beyond compare.

So while you're roasting in the summer sun,
We'll be dropping content—you know, just for fun.
It might not be Christmas, but it’s under wraps,
This update mustn't be hot, for it’s a Cold Snap!
