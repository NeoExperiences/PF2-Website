Grenades were a integral part of Quake Team Fortress and Team Fortress Classic, they were essentially one of the main mechanics in both games.

As we all know Team Fortress 2 was supposed to be closer to a port of TFC to the Source engine, but with time the developers came to realise that the grenades introduced a major shift in balancing when they were introduced again in Team Fortress 2. While playtesting, the dev team didn't know how to properly utilize these grenades and how to balance them properly. Ultimately, they feared players spamming these grenades by going to a resupply locker after expending their supply to refill their 'nades or firing them all off in a certain death situation.

After the devs realised how hard it would be for them to balance the grenades, especially with all the new and improved mechanics they added into the game they decided to cut them in April of 2007.

## Pre-Fortress 2 and Grenades.

The main goal of Pre-Fortress 2 was always to add in scrapped features from the nearly 2 years before TF2's release, and yeah, while we enjoy recreating cut mechanics from TF2, balance still plays a big role in this game as a unbalanced game is never fun, especially for players on the receiving end.

Like a certain Reggie Fils-Aime said,
> "The game is fun. The game is a battle. If it's not
> fun, why bother? If it's not a battle, where's the fun?"

Balancing plays a big part in the enjoyment of any video game. Now, because we wanted to stay pretty much 99% beta accurate, we had a clearcut conflict of interest. TF2 didn't have grenades because the developers where building a game that didn't require them to be fun in the long run with the addition of new game modes like CP. Because of this, grenades were cut late into the game's development.

But, we wanted to create a experience that would be fun when you played the game with grenades so we went to work and and started work on balancing the grenades with all the features that we had. At that point we stopped being totally beta accurate with the goal of making a game fun and replayable without being frustrated by someone who has played TFC before and knows every quirk and trick in it. Since Open Beta Version 0.5 we have started balancing the game, and so far we are still experimenting with it but are at a position where we can say we succeeded in what Valve couldn't do.

We made the game fun with grenades, and I'd say we're damn proud of it.
