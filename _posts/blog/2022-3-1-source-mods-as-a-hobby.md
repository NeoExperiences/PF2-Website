# TF2 2006 vs TF2 2008

A lot of people ask us why do we exist when TF2C is alive and thriving. Well first of all you must understand the goals of TF2C versus the goals of PF2. Pre-Fortress 2 aims to restore and fix Team Fortress 2 Beta gameplay, whereas Team Fortress 2 Classic has only restored very minimal elements from the beta, solely nail gun and tranq. It brings back things from TF Classic namely 4 team and escort's civilian. Mostly includes and focusing on many cut concepts from post release of TF2. I like to think of it as PF2 is TF2 in 2006, and TF2C is TF2 in 2008. Our games focus on different eras of the game, It would be safer to assume that TF2C is the game that comes after PF2 and release TF2 if they were a trilogy. None of us are anti-Valve, we are all fans of Valve games and have been playing them for years. We are simply wanting to try something different.

# All volunteers

Many of the developers of TF2C and OF are the same people, this is not on purpose but you'll find that they're the only people available or willing to work on these projects. Where they differ most is in the Project Lead and goal of the mod. On the PF2 Team we have plenty of new faces to Source Modding and plenty of veterans of the genre. We work on these projects out of love, passion, and hobby. You'll find they fulfill a spot in our hearts where TF2 has not filled, or the curiousity in our brains where we went, "What if?". "What if TF2 was more like how it was in 2008 and kept the post release cut concepts instead of focusing on hats?", "What if Team Fortress 2, was more lik Team Fortress Classic and kept the beta concepts?". This is the common approach to how people in the Source Mod scene approach these games. Open Fortress is a game where someone said "I miss deathmatch gameplay! Let's make a Team Fortress Arena Shooter". Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

# Female Models

The female models files were found in the 2009 Sniper vs Spy content and not at all found in the 2008 leaked code. We want them, but the models are post release content. Not to mention that during TFConnect Winter 2021, Robin Walker stated his regrets for the 10th class were "not making female playermodels". If we were to add them, it would be further down the line after the release of our new model as it is not high on the priority list.
