## Requirements
To play Pre-Fortress 2 you **must** have [Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer](steam://install/243750) installed.

## Optional Requirements
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) or another program capable of opening .7z files. Preferably not WinRAR.
- [Team Fortress 2](steam://install/440)

## Downloads
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FUUfHo5NbxvCNsKDUiZVxU4x8q8NkaKk/view){:target="_blank"}
- [Mega.nz](https://mega.nz/file/9CxTXKyT#rqFGOpbJykJqFsBsxUeWaimJF82ygj-BbulEn2Yf8vI){:target="_blank"}
- [Yandex.ru](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/yegcFzbO1h9Duw){:target="_blank"}

If you're on Windows you can use this helper installer in addition to one of the archives above:
- [Helper Installer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/843318766245904434/934288428772777984/pf2-0.6-full-installer.exe)

## Installation
If you're using the helper installer, just run it in the same folder as the archive, and it'll handle everything for you.

<br>

If you're not using the installer, open the archive in 7-Zip, navigate to the `sourcemods` folder and extract the `pf2` folder there.
The `sourcemods` folder can usually be found in these locations:
- Windows - **C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/**
- Linux - **~/.steam/steam/sourcemods/**
- Mac - **/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/**

A correct install should look something like this:

## Post-Installation
You will need to restart Steam in order for the mod to appear in your library. To do that, open up Steam, press the `Steam` button at the top-left of the window then press `Exit`. Wait a moment for Steam to fully shutdown, then reopen Steam. 

If all went well you should see `Pre-Fortress 2: Open Beta` in your library
